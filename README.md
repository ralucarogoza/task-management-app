# Task Management App
This web application was developed in collaboration with a colleague using the ASP.NET framework. We prioritized the backend development of the application. We started from database design and we created the authentication system so that users can have two roles: *admin* and *regular user*. Users can create accounts and add new projects and members. The person who made the project will be the organizer and can assign tasks to his colleagues who can add comments to them.
